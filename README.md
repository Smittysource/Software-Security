  Artemis Financial is a globally available financial consulting company that creates financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The client has requested modifications to their application to enable secure communication and storage of data.
  Identifying and securing each of the different areas of vulnerability in their application was difficult, but I think I managed to do it well without adding additional vulnerabilities. Coding securely is extremely important. Ensuring that the code is secure as it is being developed reduces the amount of recoding or possibly redesigning of the system at later stages in the development process. This could cause a complete failure of the project if too much is not caught early enough. For the client, having a secure application creates trust between them and their own clients. For the developing company, it increases the chances for future work and maintianing their own client base.
